# DevLog - 0.1

## Version 0.1.0 (10/06/2022)
- Beginning of the A-Level Documentation
    - So far there is a project brief describing what i'm going to do
        - This isn't neccassary by the A-level standard but i'm still going to do it because it is helpful when looking back and seeing what i said i would do
    - Fixed the Ember Asserts not showing up the "[EMBER]" text before the message
